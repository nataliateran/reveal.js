        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Verbecc (https://github.com/bretttolbert/verbecc) repository is a repository about a software that takes verbs from different foreign languages and predicts their conjugates in a desired tense. This project supports Catalan, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian. This project can be used by anyone learning a lamguage or anyone who is fluent in a language, but is just stuck on how to conjugate something. </p>

        <h2>Non-Code Contribution Opportunities</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of ways to contribute to this repository without using code. One way that seems most appropriate for someone like me would be to suggect a small change like the author of this issue (https://github.com/bretttolbert/verbecc/issues/22) did. In this issue, the user suggested a change to the project. The user pointed out that while the project is very good with predicting the conjugated forms of a verb, it would be neat of the project could do the opposite. In other words, this user suggested that the project would be able to take a conjugated verb and convert it to its infinitive.These contributions are valuable as they can open the door to the repository expanding its horizons and including new and different features.</p>

        <h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2>
        <p>It did not look like there were any explicit contributuin guidelines, however, there are many ways to contribute. For some examples, someone can open an issue and suggest a feature like the user mentioned on the previous slide did. Likewise, someone who is confortable with one of the languages supported by the project can suggect that verbs are added to the project. To do this, they need create an issue with the verb they want to add along with the conjugfations they would want to see..</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>I plan to review the Spanish verbs already in the project and suggest any useful ones that are missing. Since I'm comfortable with Spanish, I can create an issue with the verb and its conjugations. All I need is the project and a list of verbs, and I hope to start this weekend.</p>
