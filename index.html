        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/bretttolbert/verbecc">Verbecc/a> repository is a repository about a software that takes verbs from different foreign languages and predicts their conjugates in a desired tense. This project supports Catalan, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian. This project can be used by anyone learning a lamguage or anyone who is fluent in a language, but is just stuck on how to conjugate something. </p>

        <h2>Non-Code Contribution Opportunities</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to contribute to this repository without writing code. For example, like the author of <a href="https://github.com/bretttolbert/verbecc/issues/22">Issue #22/a>, I could suggest a feature. That user suggested a feature that would make turning a conjugated verb back into its infinitive possible. Suggestions like these are valuable because they help expand the projectâ€™s capabilities.</p>

        <h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2>
        <p>It did not look like there were any explicit contributuing guidelines, however, there are many ways to contribute. For example, someone can open an issue and suggest a feature like the user mentioned on the previous slide did. Likewise, someone who is confortable with one of the languages supported by the project can suggect that verbs are added to the project. To do this, they need create an issue with the verb they want to add along with the conjugfations they would want to see.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>I plan to review the Spanish verbs already in the project and suggest any useful ones that are missing. Since I'm comfortable with Spanish, I can create an issue with the verb and its conjugations. All I need is the project and a list of verbs, and I hope to start this weekend.</p>
